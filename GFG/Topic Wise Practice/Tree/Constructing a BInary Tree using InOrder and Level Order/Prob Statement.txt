Given inorder and level-order traversals of a Binary Tree, construct the Binary Tree and return the root Node. 

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N, denoting number of elements is respective arrays. Second and third line consists of arrays containing Inorder and Level-order traversal respectively.

Output:
Single line output, print the preOrder traversal of array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100

Example:
Input:
2
3
1 0 2 
0 1 2 
7
3 1 4 0 5 2 6 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Output:
0 1 2
0 1 3 4 2 5 6
